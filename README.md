# What is this project about?
This project is designed to showcase some of my skills and experiences, both from my education and practical work outside of it.

# Why Astro with vanilla JS and TailwindCSS?
Frameworks like React or Svelte can significantly streamline development by abstracting away complexity and providing built-in solutions for common tasks. However, when building a small project like this, frameworks often introduce features and tools that may not be needed, leading to unnecessary bloat. To avoid this, I decided to use Astro, which is great for static websites and allows me to focus on content while minimizing overhead.

I also chose to work with vanilla JS and CSS to deepen my understanding of these technologies.

However, midway through the project, I realized that my approach to media queries isntâ€™t as pretty as it could have been as I forgot that Tailwind can handle that. (And trying to avoid using JS made it complicated to handle some very basic user interaction).

# Why not just use a framework, then?
In a previous project, I cloned Terradle, a Wordle version of Terraria, from [cxhuy](https://github.com/cxhuy/terradle-web). Instead of relying on a framework like Svelte, I built it entirely using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS (with some TailwindCSS for styling). My aim was to get a deeper understanding of the fundamentals and how everything works when building from scratch.

While this experience taught me some stuff about these technologies, I quickly realized that frameworks like React or Svelte provide significant advantages, especially for projects that involve state handling. They reduce development time and help keep the codebase clean and maintainable by abstracting away repetitive tasks.

Moving forward, a good balance is all that is needed ðŸ˜‰
